# How to Use the Skedulr App
This is a desktop application that I built to use for automating my daily daily emails to my family and friends to keep motivating them and keeping them positive for tomorrow. This way I don't need to worry about sending it every single day because the app will be doing it for me every day without my help.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `py -m virtualenv env`

Creates the environment file 'env' in the directory.

### `source env/Scripts/activate` (if you're on bash)
### `env\Scripts\activate` (if you're on cmd/terminal)

Activates the project's environment ('env').\
**To deactivate, run `deactivate`.**

### `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Installs the necessary dependencies / packages that are needed for the app to run properly.\
